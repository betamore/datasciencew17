    "We have introduce several different concepts in class to understanding model performance throughout the last few weeks; here is one primary location that we can refer to for regressions and classification problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "Definition: On (technically) a scale of 0 to 1, how well does this regression explain the variance in our data?  \n",
    "_note: can be negative if the regression model is inversely related, though this rarely occurs_\n",

    "math: $R^2=\\dfrac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* we like this because: It's easily explainable on a scale, independent of what your y represents. very universal\n",
    "* we don't like this because: it doesn't actually represent any \"error\" amount\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The square root of the mean of the squared errors, where squared error = $(y_{true} - y_{pred})^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "math: $\\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum(y_{true} - y_{pred})^{2}}$\n",

    "* we like this because: It represents error against the y units, unlike $R^2$, and punishes larger error\n",

    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "* **business prop**: in a business decision, what's the value to error? How much is a true positive worth to a business vs a false positive or false negative? Consider weighting against some business goal.\n",

    "Note there are two routes to go with using AUC in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **plotting classes**: calculate the roc using the binary class labels to gain a single point on the plot and visualize\n",
    "* **plotting scores/probalities**: calcuate the roc using the probalities for class $y_1$. Helpful to visualize when the data may not be weighted normally (a priori is not around .5)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of sklearn's model metrics are in the [sklearn metrics page](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics). Keep this around as a reference point so you know how to run the metrics you need to use!"
