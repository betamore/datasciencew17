    "* $β$ = regression coefficient (the model “parameter”)\n",
    "* $ε$ = residual (the prediction error)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **cost function** or goal of the ordinary least squares regression is to find the linear solution with the least sum of square error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solving for OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll break down the math here:\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLS Linear Regression is just matrix algebra (the stuff from up above!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go over the math by hand so we can understand how we determine the regression coefficient.\n",

    "A linear regression in its simplest form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "but we can assume that our $\\alpha$ (y-itercept)is either 0 or 1, and $\\epsilon$ (error) is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = βx$\n",
    "\n",
    "but we want to solve for β, which means our new equation now looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$β = ( X^TX)^{-1} X^Ty$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How did we get there?\n",
    "\n",
    "The below is problematic, as we cannot divide by a matrix! So we first square the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "$β = \\frac{y}x == \\frac{xy}{x^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall in algebra:\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Logistic function\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is an implementation of the linear regression often used to solve a **binary** problem (though it can be used to do others). What sets it apart from linear discriminant models (say, a line that separates two classes) is that it provides _probabilities_ of a given class, as opposed to assigning a class. Since most classification problems are binary, the results are interpretive, much like a linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class probability is generally represented in a space of $0$ to $inf$. To use a linear model to determine probality of a given class, we want to use a function that gives us results from $-inf$ to $inf$. Therefore, to get to this mode, we use log, and work with log odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge is that linear models (OLS, logistic, etc) often expect some type of normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of the Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Interpretable (coefficients; weights)\n",
    "* Parameters are few : increase linearly with dimensionality\n",
    "* Extensible to multi-class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equation\n",
    " $P(Y=1) = \\dfrac{e^{(\\alpha + \\beta x)}}{1 + e^{(\\alpha + \\beta x)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coefficient Estimation: Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "* Which values of the coefficients make the observed data most likely to have occurred?\n",
    "* Take the Beta and raise $10^\\beta$ for odds ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Odds, Log-odds\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients of the logistic regression represent the log-odds of the target given that feature. We'll need to use the `exp()` function to transform them into more human readable odds ratios."
